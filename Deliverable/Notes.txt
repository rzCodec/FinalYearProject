Mentor Notes
============

- When a user is looking at their profile, there might be multiple genres that a person wants to listen to.
- Something more relevant to the recent activity like a news feed such as following artists.
- For the website, as soon as the user logins in they have a feel for a social aspect.
- Contrast the dark colours in the website by using lighter colors.
- The home menu is too dark and should be lighter or contrast with other brighter colours.


=========== What the users should experience the first time they visit the website ===========================================

- What is the first thing a user wants to experience?
  An example such as real up to date information.
- Some info-graphic like a real world statistic.
- You can include small sounds snippets on the website for people to listen.
- Be a little bit less business orientated and more music themed. Have more variety with the color theme.
- Give a good first impression on the website so users will feel inclined to use it. 
- Does not need many pages and keep users on one page.
- It should have less text and more visuals such as color codes for specific sections such as the statistics section is color coded blue.



* Feedback on the PowerPoint Presentation *

====== Slides ==========
- Team details on the cover page.
- Don't have 5 lines per slide with no more than 7 words per line.
- Only have the key points and talk about those particular points in detail.


The Problems
============
- Summarise the problems, don't give too much detail but make sure to get the problem addressed

The solution
============
- Quick breakdown of the solution like website for stats and mobile app does the locating.

===== Implementation =========
- Think of the user as if they are completely clueless about how the website works.
- Use of github
- A snapshot what the system looked it at that particular point.
- For important presentations like Alpha and Beta
  Use a 3G card if you need to connect to the internet, because the wifi internet connection at UJ is unstable
- Marks on Functionality & User Experience
- Keep your use cases, class diagrams and activity diagrams up to date as you work together on the project.

- Prototype Interface
- Page Description : Who and What will use it
- Show the GUI using paint or other
- Tell and show what happens for each button, etc
- Does it do it on the current page or does it take it elsewhere
- If it is from another site you don't need to redraw it. 
- The most important pages related to those processes 
  such as home pages, login pages, collaborating pages
- The mobile app will need to have more user interfaces diagrams.

Interacting actors with the subsystems go on the right
