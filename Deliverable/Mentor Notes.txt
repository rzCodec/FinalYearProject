13 October 2017 Mentor Notes

** Website **
- Text a bit narrow and washed out, perhaps a larger font or bold style could help
- Available skills are a bit difficult to read, make use of correct colour contrasts and backgrounds

** Reporting **
- Should be able to see all skills on the x-axis
- Set time frames between multiple months/weeks/days 
  such as clicking a start date and end date and then showing reports/stats between those two dates
- Have an option to convert the reports to a pdf file for easier reading, sharing and printing
