Updated Mentor Notes
21 October 2017 Mentor Notes

** Slides **
- Move the slides as you present to show relevant information.
- Make use of keycards (should contain bullet points to glance at and remember what you want to say.)

** Website UI**
- Text a bit narrow and washed out, perhaps a larger font or bold style could help
- Available skills are a bit difficult to read, make use of correct colour contrasts and backgrounds

** Reporting **
- Should be able to see all skills on the x-axis
- Set time frames between multiple months/weeks/days 
  such as clicking a start date and end date and then showing reports/stats between those two dates
- Have an option (like a button) to convert the reports to a pdf file for easier reading, sharing and printing 
- Show a user's rating for each event that has finished by using a line graph. This report shows a musician's performance and credibility.
- Show event history for a specific user, try sorting the history by a specific skill that the user can click on.
  For example, only show all event history that has the only has the Drummer skill.
  
  Sort event history by other attributes like event visibility (public, private, etc)
  
- Show a bar graph that can be ordered such as the most common skills all users have to the least common skills and vice-versa.
- You can show a user's followers and show which skill is the most common among the followers.
- Show the top 5% or 10% of all users in the system with the highest overall skill ratings
