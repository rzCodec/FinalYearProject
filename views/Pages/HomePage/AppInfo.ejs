                                One common flaw we have observed with the music industry is it's lack of easy
                                connectivity.
                                When people want to colaborate, they have to keep going through channels that lack clear
                                communication, and it's often with people who are too far away. That is where our app
                                comes
                                in, we allow people to find like-minded artists around them that share the same interest
                                of
                                making great music with a team,</p >

                                nav bar, you will need a SoundCloud account to prove that you have been grinding and
                                contributing to being a great artist. Now go download it and make your future.</p >
